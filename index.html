<h2>Interest In Information Technology

<h3>1. What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).



</body>

<p>Information Technology (commonly abbreviated to I.T.) is the means by which most of my interests are a product of, or gives tremendous assistance to. Games, videos and communication are a few of many interests I have that are impacted by it. What primarily influenced me was the growing desire to understand, replicate and draw influence from how IT was used to create and improve many of my interests. I reached an intense level of interest in IT around age 17. This was the case because at around this age I was heavily engaged in many of my IT-related interests. I believe I have an above-average understanding of how to use most IT programs that the general public would use. I have no knowledge worth noting past that level. I have no past participation in IT studies run by education providers. Most that I know about I.T. has come from using computer programs as an end-user.

<h3>2. Why did you choose to come to RMIT?

<p>I chose to study this subject to put myself on a path towards being in a career I would be comfortable and productive in. When I realised that my current job is not where I want to be in the long-term, and that my current education would make it challenging to do anything about it, I decided to study something that would result in a career more suitable for me. Secondly, online study was the only option I had available for this course because of my current education. Even if I had the option, I would likely still choose online because the convenience and flexibility it brings are incredibly helpful. As for why I chose RMIT specifically, I knew it as a reputable University that people I know have said is a great choice for this field of study. So when I was offered enrolment after applying, it was an easy offer to accept.

<h3>3. What do you expect to learn during your studies?

<p>I expect to learn fundamental I.T.-related skills that directly relate to the outlined topics within the Bachelor of I.T. During this course I hope to also learn other useful skills that are not specific to I.T. Universal skills such as time management, organisation and planning could improve by structuring days efficiently around study and meeting deadlines (without leaving things to the last minute). Work-coordination, assertiveness, communication and other skills could also see improvement from participating in group tasks. Going into this course with the little research I’ve done into the different fields of I.T. Cyber security and software development stand out the most as a future career. From what I can tell, both fields focus on logic, as well as often a strong reliance on fixed procedures. Following systems and logical thought are both attributes I excel at. Nearing the end of these studies, I expect to have made up my mind on which specific area of the IT field I want to pursue a career in.



<h2>Ideal Job: Cyber Security Manager

  <img src="FUTUREYOU.PNG" alt="Job Advertisement" width="350" height="450">

<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39695700?type=standard&searchrequesttoken=f540f4e7-5307-43f5-aa5b-07138e23e863">Link to the job advertisement</a>

<h3>Description of the position and why I find it appealing:

<p>A Cyber Security Consultant position is being advertised by an unidentified professional services firm. Cyber Security Consultants assess computer hardware and software for vulnerabilities. When vulnerabilities are discovered, they implement solutions that remove the vulnerabilities. The employer promises to provide a future employee exposure to a broader range of Cyber Security topics and projects, rather than following the tradition of placing the employee into a narrowly focused area.  The employee will also be assisted with these topics and projects by a one on one mentorship from both the Cyber Security Partner and Director.

<p>The position is appealing to me in a few ways. Being a full time position, it helps maintain financial stability long term. The field of IT that is primarily focused in the advertised position is very suitable as it incorporates a number of my strongest attributes. The average salary in Melbourne for this job is decent. Lastly, the range of work being offered is something I find very enticing due to the varying knowledge and experience I would attain in the industry.

<p>Lastly, the employers looking for someone who has strong communication, client engagement and presentation skills. Although I have interpersonal skills such as these, I am sure they need to be refined to meet the expectations of the employer.

<h3>Description of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position:

<p>The employer has listed three skills that applicants must require for this advertised position. The first mentioned is that applicants must know how to “assess, develop, implement, optimise, and document a comprehensive and broad set of security technologies and processes”. What this means is that applicants need to know about how to make use of Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) for increased effectiveness of Cyber Security in the workplace.

<p>The second skill required is “knowledge of common Cyber Security regulations, standards and compliance requirements”. They want applicants to already know about the threats posed to the online security of individuals and organisations and how they can prevent or fix breaches in computer systems. Organisations are forced to comply with these Cyber Security directives by the government.

<p>The last skill they require is “strong communication, client engagement and presentation skills”. As this job involves interacting with clients, interpersonal skills are important and need to be strong. They would prefer if applicants had at least 1-2 years prior consulting experience and any security certifications (e.g. OSCP, GPEN).

<h3>Description of the skills, qualifications and experience I currently have:

<p>Although I neither have any of the skills, qualifications nor experience the employer highlights as required or preferential for the advertised position, I do have work-related skills that may prove useful that they have not mentioned. One skill I have is being able to focus intensely on any task for extended periods of time. My ability to focus intensely would also benefit my quality of work. Critical thinking is another skill I excel at, and that should also prove useful in Cyber Security. I often look at all information and assess all possibilities severity and likelihood to form a decision or conclusion.

<h3>Plan to obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position:

<p>The following plan has no defined order because there is no visible benefit for which one is done when (although completing a Bachelor of IT and/or a Bachelor of Cyber Security should be one of the first steps):
- Complete Bachelor of Information Technology within three to six years (depending on full time or part time workload)
- Complete a Bachelor of Cyber Security (After completing Bachelor of IT or leave Bachelor of IT for this course)
- Acquire a IAPSC membership (International Association of Professional Security Consultants)
-  Possibly acquire other certifications such as:
*	GIAC (Security Certifications)
*	OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)
*	CSC (Certified Security Consultant)
*	CPP (Certified Protection Professional)
*	PSP (Physical Security Professional)
*	CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional)
- Develop communication/presentation skills through researching tips and finding opportunities to practise in front of people (my soft skills that I lack).
- Develop any Cyber Security-specific skills necessary for this job that I haven’t learnt in my studies.
- Send out applications to places that offer work experience as a Cyber Security Consultant to gain the necessary 1-2 years work experience
- Make sure I’m prepared for the interview process (appearance, conversations, questions etc...

<h2>Personal Profile

<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?

<p>The combined result of these three tests I took summarise many of my personal traits. Below are some highlights of major aspects of the results.

<p>Out of my top three personality type matches my Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test concluded with, I believe INTP (The Architect) is the closest representation of my Myers-Briggs personality test. People of this type are preoccupied with thoughts on how things work, what their purpose is, the structure of systems and tradition and how things could be improved. I resonate strongly with these thoughts.

<p>The Big Five personality test results shows that I have a tendency towards abstract thinking, introversion and neuroticism. The results for the “Conscientiousness” category shows a lack of self-discipline. The “Agreeableness” category shows little preference for putting my needs above others or vice versa.

<p>The Learning Style test results concluded that I am primarily an Auditory learner, as opposed to a Visual or Tactile learner. This means that, for example, if I were to be read a story by a teacher, I would learn it easier than if I had to either read it to myself in my head, view visual depictions of the story or act out the story (by myself or as a group).

<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?

<p>All of the results can be seen to likely influence my behaviour in a team. I will present some examples of how the results may influence my behaviour in a team, as well as strategies to work around problematic traits and maximise use of useful traits below:

<p>INTROVERSION-As I am predominantly introverted, I may not assert myself enough, which affects the whole teamwork process (quantity and quality of my participation). I may struggle to voice my opinions and participate in team activities. I must make an effort to assert myself so that I can freely share my ideas, confidently participate in teamwork and provide constructive feedback to others in the team.

<p>LOGICAL THINKING-I have a strong leniency toward logic and reason over emotions. It would likely mean that my judgement would be clearer of emotional influence, leading to more rational decisions. On the other hand, this logical dominance may not take into account others emotional needs enough in discussions, tasks and decisions when necessary. I must consciously observe and consider others emotions with more frequency when participating in the team.

<p>LEARNING STYLES-Being that my primary learning style is auditory, incorporating audio-based components for team communication and participation would positively influence my behaviour in a team. All members of the team could also take into account each of our preferred learning styles when working together for increased team behaviour.

<p>ABSTRACT/ANALYSIS/SCEPTIC-Because I am very analytical, value scepticism and often think in abstract, the thoughts I have that relate to my teams focus may draw attention to something useful that no one else would have thought about. I should focus the majority of my contribution to areas in the teamwork that benefit most from these thought patterns.

<p>NEUROTICISM-My high levels of neuroticism could affect my behaviour in a team. The negative emotions that arise from team problems like under-performance, falling behind in work output, personal emotional strain between team members or bad teamwork could affect my behaviour in the team. My mood and work effort may plummet as a result. To minimise the number of instances and severity of situations that may lower my mood and work effort, the whole team must keep the quality of organisation, planning, communication and work output satisfactory.

<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?

<p>For the best way to decide who I should make a team with, I should prioritise people who excel in traits that make up for a trait I lack, or if traits they have compliment any of my strong traits. For instance, someone with strong extroversion skills may improve communication and interpersonal relations both inside and outside the group. As I am an introvert, this is something I would likely find difficult to do myself. Also, finding other logical thinkers would compliment my lack of focus on emotions. There would be less instances of emotional conflict, and so sharing a preference for logic may also speed up the thought process due to increased exchange of ideas because of clearer minds.


<h2>PROJECT IDEA-Video Game System Emulation

<h3>OVERVIEW

<p>I have chosen video game system emulation as my project idea. Along with creating the emulators themselves, a front-end for emulators will also be created to act as a directory for the emulators and video games. The front-end program will have many adjustable features. Each emulators menu will provide a host of settings that can increase performance and allow customisation. The emulators will be able to support mods for the games. Different operating systems supported will have their respective version of the software. Development of the emulator will be coding intensive. The programming language C++ (or C) will be used to create the emulators and the front-end program.

<h3>MOTIVATION

<p>Video game emulators are something I have been using usually on a weekly basis for a number of years. I have spent countless hours playing a wide range of video games on a variety of consoles through emulation.  I have also spent many hours happily tweaking two certain emulators (namely a Playstation 2 and a Gamecube/Wii emulator) highly adjustable settings and applying mods to maximise performance. Aside from my personal relationship with these types of programs, they are useful for preserving retro video games and their communities. Emulators keep these retro games from being forgotten by increasing their accessibility dramatically. These games will likely find two types of audience; those driven by nostalgia and new players.

<h3>DESCRIPTION

<p>Both the emulators and the front-end program will have a wide array of features. The front-end will have a generous amount of user interface (or UI for short) customisation.

<p>The two main features of this front-end program is it’s ability to act as a virtual library for video games and consoles, as well as it’s management of the settings for each specific emulator. How the lists of consoles and video games are ordered, as well as how they look, is largely left to the person using the program. Ordering of the library is alike to ordering files with File Explorer. Systems will act as folders and video games will act like files. A system won’t be limited to one folder directory. They could use any image (regardless of file extension) as the portrait of whichever video game or console they have selected.  The user would also have the default option to use a database of official 3D video game cases (disc/cartridge-only images also) and system images for an official-looking representation of their games.

<p>Settings for all emulators will be universally managed through the front-end program. The user will be able to make setting presets for individual emulators. The user can go a step further and create presets for specific video games to maximise performance. A simpler, albeit unadvised route will also be available that allows the front-end to auto-manage emulation settings. Every system has a different choice of settings. One setting that will vary compared to each system are game-specific fixes/hacks. These performance settings can allow improvements like smoother textures or higher resolutions. Mod support will also be possible. These mods will largely be cheats converted from game-cheat tools like “Action Replay” or “GameShark”. Mods designed specifically for emulated games will also be supported.

<p>Main features aside, there will be a selection of basic themes for the programs menu (solid colour combinations) as well as support for custom themes made by the user. There would also be an option to enable one of the special effect presets that come with the program.  There will be support from a wide range of controller inputs (e.g. Xbox, Playstation, keyboard and mouse, unbranded etc…).

<p>The systems likely to be emulated will be part of a past-generation lineup. The first systems that will be emulated are the Playstation 2, Nintendo 64, and the Xbox. Game compatibility will be a very slow and gradual process. That means that, for a while, their won’t be many games supported.  Emulation performance (e.g. emulation speed, hardware usage etc…) will also be displayed in the emulations window bar or shown in a popup menu opened by a shortcut. The ability to suspend the emulation process will be present for convenience.

<h3>TOOLS AND technologies

<p>Access to a computer system that is substantially more powerful than the systems being emulated is required for testing the emulators. A C++ or C compiler is required for coding. Working hardware of the systems is needed to emulate each system as software. A legal copy of the games is required for dumping their files and testing the games compatibility with the emulator builds. There must also be access to planned compatible operating systems for development of their respective versions. Possession of the BIOS of systems planned to be emulated are required.

<h3>SKILLS REQUIRED

<p>The programs will be written in C++ or C. There is a need for competency in those programming languages. Knowing how to reverse engineer systems, reconstruct their hardware as software, obtain their system BIOS dumps, crack their systems game storage and dump the games files from its cartridge/disc (in that order) is required. Solutions to non-standard techniques (which prevent misuse of the intellectual property) used in a specific systems hardware must be known for successful emulation of that system. In contrast to the programming languages compiler being easy to obtain, accessing the video game systems software would be incredibly difficult due to the extreme lengths the systems developers would likely have gone to to prevent any unwarranted access. The chances of finding a working unit decreases the older that system becomes. A systems expense and rarity of advertised system units may also increase with age. Developing a single system emulator is a long and difficult task. Developing multiple emulators and applying them to a front-end I also made would be an impressive feat.

<h3>OUTCOME

<p>The end result of this project will be a multitude of functional console system emulators that use a front-end program for ease of management and optimal performance. Games being played likely won’t be as fast as if the games were running on their original platform due to the complexity and limitations in software emulating hardware. Glitches and crashes may also plague even games deemed compatible. Although emulation speed may cause issues, depending on the computers specifications, visuals (or possibly even things like frame-rate) could be tweaked to be better than the console associated with the game. This product will assist the accessibility to certain video games, preserve their contents as well as breathe life into their dying communities.
