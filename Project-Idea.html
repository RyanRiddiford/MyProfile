    <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>

<p>I have chosen video game system emulation as my project idea. Along with creating the emulators themselves, a front-end for emulators will also be created to act as a directory for the emulators and video games. The front-end program will have many adjustable features. Each emulators menu will provide a host of settings that can increase performance and allow customisation. The emulators will be able to support mods for the games. Different operating systems supported will have their respective version of the software. Development of the emulator will be coding intensive. The programming language C++ (or C) will be used to create the emulators and the front-end program.
</p>
<h3>MOTIVATION</h3>

<p>Video game emulators are something I have been using usually on a weekly basis for a number of years. I have spent countless hours playing a wide range of video games on a variety of consoles through emulation.  I have also spent many hours happily tweaking two certain emulators (namely a Playstation 2 and a Gamecube/Wii emulator) highly adjustable settings and applying mods to maximise performance. Aside from my personal relationship with these types of programs, they are useful for preserving retro video games and their communities. Emulators keep these retro games from being forgotten by increasing their accessibility dramatically. These games will likely find two types of audience; those driven by nostalgia and new players.
</p>
<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p>Both the emulators and the front-end program will have a wide array of features. The front-end will have a generous amount of user interface (or UI for short) customisation.
</p>
<p>The two main features of this front-end program is its ability to act as a virtual library for video games and consoles, and its management of the settings for each specific emulator. How the lists of consoles and video games are ordered, as well as how they look, is largely left to the person using the program. Ordering of the library is alike to ordering files with File Explorer. Systems will act as folders and video games will act like files. A system won’t be limited to one folder directory. They could use any image (regardless of file extension) as the portrait of whichever video game or console they have selected.  The user would also have the default option to use a database of official 3D video game cases (disc/cartridge-only images also) and system images for an official-looking representation of their games.
</p>
<p>Settings for all emulators will be universally managed through the front-end program. The user will be able to make setting presets for individual emulators. The user can go a step further and create presets for specific video games to maximise performance. A simpler, albeit unadvised route will also be available that allows the front-end to auto-manage emulation settings. Every system has a different choice of settings. One setting that will vary compared to each system are game-specific fixes/hacks. These performance settings can allow improvements like smoother textures or higher resolutions. Mod support will also be possible. These mods will largely be cheats converted from game-cheat tools like “Action Replay” or “GameShark”. Mods designed specifically for emulated games will also be supported.
</p>
<p>Main features aside, there will be a selection of basic themes for the programs menu (solid colour combinations) as well as support for custom themes made by the user. There would also be an option to enable one of the special effect presets that come with the program.  There will be support from a wide range of controller inputs (e.g. Xbox, Playstation, keyboard and mouse, unbranded etc…).
</p>
<p>The systems likely to be emulated will be part of a past-generation lineup. The first systems that will be emulated are the Playstation 2, Nintendo 64, and the Xbox. Game compatibility will be a very slow and gradual process. That means that, for a while, there won’t be many games supported.  Emulation performance (e.g. emulation speed, hardware usage etc…) will also be displayed in the emulations window bar or shown in a popup menu opened by a shortcut. The ability to suspend the emulation process will be present for convenience.
</p>
<h3>TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES</h3>

<p>Access to a computer system that is substantially more powerful than the systems being emulated is required for testing the emulators. A C++ or C compiler is required for coding. Working hardware of the systems is needed to emulate each system as software. A legal copy of the games is required for dumping their files and testing the games compatibility with the emulator builds. There must also be access to planned compatible operating systems for development of their respective versions. Possession of the BIOS of systems planned to be emulated are required.
</p>
<h3>SKILLS REQUIRED</h3>

<p>The programs will be written in C++ or C. There is a need for competency in those programming languages. Knowing how to reverse engineer systems, reconstruct their hardware as software, obtain their system BIOS dumps, crack their systems game storage and dump the games files from its cartridge/disc (in that order) is required. Solutions to non-standard techniques (which prevent misuse of the intellectual property) used in a specific systems hardware must be known for successful emulation of that system. In contrast to the programming languages compiler being easy to obtain, accessing the video game systems software would be incredibly difficult, due to the extreme lengths the systems developers would likely have gone to, to prevent any unwarranted access. The chances of finding a working unit decreases the older that system becomes. A systems expense and rarity of advertised system units may increase with age. Developing a single system emulator is a long and difficult task. Developing multiple emulators and applying them to a front-end I also made, would be an impressive feat.
</p>
<h3>OUTCOME</h3>

<p>The end result of this project will be a multitude of functional console system emulators that use a front-end program for ease of management and optimal performance. Games being played likely won’t be as fast as if the games were running on their original platform due to the complexity and limitations in software emulating hardware. Glitches and crashes may also plague even games deemed compatible. Although emulation speed may cause issues, depending on the computer's specifications, visuals (or possibly even things like frame-rate) could be tweaked to be better than the console associated with the game. This product will assist the accessibility to certain video games, preserve their contents as well as breathe life into their dying communities.
